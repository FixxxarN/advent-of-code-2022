| Day | Rank part 1 | Time part 1 | Rank part 2 | Time part 2 | Performance | Reason
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| 1 | 5092 | 00:09:27 | 4474 | 00:02:31 | OK / BAD | Didn't read the text correctly
| 2 | 8646 | 00:21:09 | 7227 | 00:06:11 | BAD | Woke up late, had no coffee and didn't read the text corretly
| 3 | - | - | - | - | - | Didn't compete this day.
| 4 | 17940 | 01:23:51 | 16970 | 00:02:09 | BAD | Did some major noob mistakes :D. Joined array to string so 97 was "included" in the other string "6667686970"... Never test strings if they include each other when working with multiple numbers. Didn't split on '-' so when i checked the strings i checked the first and last number so i missed quite a few numbers since 60-60 became 6-0... :DDD
| 5 | 11762 | 01:02:48 | 10573 | 00:01:43 | GOOD | Felt good. Really nice exercise in my opinion. It was fun moving crates from one stack to another. My solution might not be the best one but it was fun :)
| 6 | 12354 | 00:23:10 | 12852 | 00:07:20 | OK | Didn't understand the problem at first.
